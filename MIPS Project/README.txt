In this game, an array of unique, positive, non-zero 32 bit integers will be given. The player must make a bet and guess the index of the largest element in the array. If the player guesses correctly, that element is replaced with a value of -1 and the score will increase by the amount of the bet. If the player guesses incorrectly, the score will decrease by the amount of the bet. The player can continue to make bets and guess until they are either out of points, or all elements of the array have been guessed correctly.
